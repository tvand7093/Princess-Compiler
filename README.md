## Princess Language

A stupid little programing language based on cats!

### Usage
TODO

### Building
Open the command line and navigate to the cloned folder. Run `make` and all of the project will build.
The results will go into a newly created `bin` directory. From there, just run the program you want.
For example, to run the frontend parser, just run `./princess`.
